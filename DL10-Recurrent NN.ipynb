    "# Assignment 10: Learn to Write Like Shakespeare\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will implement a simple recurrent network with one hidden layer.\n",
    "We train this network on a medium-size poem \"The Sonnet\" written by William Shakespeare and use it for auto-completing sentences/phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For training the network, we will need to transform the text into something machine-processable.\n",
    "Basically, for each of the characters in the text, we provide a $D$-element one-hot encoding vector, where D is the total number of unique characters in the dataset.\n",
    "Character sequences of length $S$ will, hence, be turned into matrices of size $\\mathbf X = \\{\\vec x^{\\{s\\}}, 1 \\leq s\\leq S\\} \\in \\mathbb R^{S\\times D}$.\n",
    "For each input, we provide the target values $\\mathbf T$ of the same size, where the target for each sample is the next character: $\\vec t^{\\{s\\}} = \\vec x ^{\\{s+1\\}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up processing, these sequences will be put into batches, i.e., $\\mathcal X, \\mathcal T \\in \\mathbb R^{B\\times S\\times D}$.\n",
    "This will automatically be achieved using the default PyTorch `DataLoader`.\n",

    "## Data and Targets Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to load the whole dataset $\\vec c \\in \\mathbb R^N$, a vector of characters, and turn the data sequence into one-hot encodings.\n",
    "For this purpose, we need to know the number $D$ of unique characters in our text.\n",
    "For simplicity, we only consider lower-case characters and special symbols such as punctuation marks.\n",
    "Also, the newline characters `'\\n'` need to be handled -- you can also leave them inside and see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each of the characters, we need to assign a one-hot encoding, and build sequences of encodings.\n",
    "For a given index $n$ into our data and a given sequence length $S$, we provide the input $\\mathbf X ^{[n]}$ and the target $\\mathbf T^{[n]}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\mathbf X^{[n]} = \\{\\mathrm{enc}(n-S+s-1) | 1 \\leq s \\leq S\\}$$\n",
    "  $$\\mathbf T^{[n]} = \\{\\mathrm{enc}(n-S+s) | 1 \\leq s \\leq S\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathrm{enc}$ is a function that returns the one-hot encoding for the character at the specified location in the original dataset $\\vec c$. \n",
    "In the case that the computation ($n-S+s-1$ or $n-S+s$) results in a negative value $\\vec 0$ should be used instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the original text `abcde`, sequence length $S=7$ and index $n=4$, we would have the representations for $x = $ `000abcd` and $t=$ `00abcde`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we implement our own `Dataset` that returns the input and target encodings for any element of our input text."
